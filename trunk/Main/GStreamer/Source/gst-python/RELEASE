Release notes for GStreamer Python bindings 0.10.18 "A pigeon carrying a 500ton block"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the
GStreamer Python Bindings.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.

      * Updates to 0.10.26 core/base API addition

Bugs fixed in this release
     
      * 592459 : info.print_info() uses info.tags.pop() to get values, but pop is destructive, so calling print_info twice can return different results

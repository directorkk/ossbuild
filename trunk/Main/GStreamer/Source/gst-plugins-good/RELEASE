Release notes for GStreamer Good Plug-ins 0.10.24 "Taking Liberties"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the
GStreamer Good Plug-ins.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.



"Such ingratitude.  After all the times I've saved your life."


A collection of plug-ins you'd want to have right next to you on the
battlefield.  Shooting sharp and making no mistakes, these plug-ins have it
all: good looks, good code, and good licensing.  Documented and dressed up
in tests.  If you're looking for a role model to base your own plug-in on,
here it is.


If you find a plot hole or a badly lip-synced line of code in them,
let us know - it is a matter of honour for us to ensure Blondie doesn't look
like he's been walking 100 miles through the desert without water.


This module contains a set of plug-ins that we consider to have good quality
  code, correct functionality, our preferred license (LGPL for the plug-in
  code, LGPL or LGPL-compatible for the supporting library).
We believe distributors can safely ship these plug-ins.
People writing elements should base their code on these elements.


Other modules containing plug-ins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plug-ins
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect



  

Features of this release
    
      * Use Orc (Optimized Inner Loops Runtime Compiler) for SIMD and
    other optimisations, and remove liboil dependency. The main goal
    for this release was to make the transition from liboil to liborc.
    Performance improvements should not be expected and will be the
    focus of future versions. liborc is an optional dependency for
    the time being, to make it possible to test and develop the very
    latest GStreamer versions on systems that don't have orc yet.
    However, without orc slow unoptimised backup code will be used
    for many performance critical code paths. Distributors are urged
    to package and ship the latest version of liborc and compile
    GStreamer modules with --enable-orc. Please do not distribute
    GStreamer packages that are not orc enabled. More information on
    the orc integration can be found in the docs/design/ directory.

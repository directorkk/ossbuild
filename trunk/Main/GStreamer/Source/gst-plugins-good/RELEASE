Release notes for GStreamer Good Plug-ins 0.10.19 "Closer to the Edit"
        


The GStreamer team is proud to announce a new release
in the 0.10.x stable series of the
GStreamer Good Plug-ins.


The 0.10.x series is a stable series targeted at end users.
It is not API or ABI compatible with the stable 0.8.x series.
It is, however, parallel installable with the 0.8.x series.



"Such ingratitude.  After all the times I've saved your life."


A collection of plug-ins you'd want to have right next to you on the
battlefield.  Shooting sharp and making no mistakes, these plug-ins have it
all: good looks, good code, and good licensing.  Documented and dressed up
in tests.  If you're looking for a role model to base your own plug-in on,
here it is.


If you find a plot hole or a badly lip-synced line of code in them,
let us know - it is a matter of honour for us to ensure Blondie doesn't look
like he's been walking 100 miles through the desert without water.


This module contains a set of plug-ins that we consider to have good quality
  code, correct functionality, our preferred license (LGPL for the plug-in
  code, LGPL or LGPL-compatible for the supporting library).
We believe distributors can safely ship these plug-ins.
People writing elements should base their code on these elements.


Other modules containing plug-ins are:


gst-plugins-base
contains a basic set of well-supported plug-ins
gst-plugins-ugly
contains a set of well-supported plug-ins, but might pose problems for
    distributors
gst-plugins-bad
contains a set of less supported plug-ins that haven't passed the
    rigorous quality testing we expect



  

Features of this release
    
      * shapewipe: moved from -bad to -good
      * avidemux: push mode seeking support
      * avidemux: drop video frames up to the desired keyframe after a seek
      * configure: cross-compilation fixes (use $PKG_CONFIG instead of pkg-config)
      * dvdepay: don't output frames until we have a header, fixes crash
      * flacdec: fix tag extraction in push mode
      * flvdemux: obtain the index from the end of an flv file in push mode
      * flvdemux: audio tags without any content are valid; indexing improvements
      * jpegdec: fix invalid memory access in parser
      * jitterbuffer: new buffering modes: low/high watermark buffering, rtp timestamps
      * matroskademux: seeking/segment fixes (esp. regression with gnonlin)
      * matroskademux: subtitle stream improvements (advance sparse streams in smaller steps)
      * multipartdemux: improve header mime-type parsing
      * qtdemux: fix ALAC codec-data handling; handle signed values in 3GPP location tag
      * qtdemux: fix frame rate cap regression; fix sample durations corner-case
      * qtdemux: Use the correct duration when comparing segments
      * pulsesink: avoid segfault when shutting down
      * pulsesink: return previous mute state if sink is not active at the moment
      * rtpbin: change how NTP time is calculated in RTCP, generating more accurate NTP timestamps if the system clock is synchronised with NTP or similar
      * rtpmp4gdepay: avoid division by 0 in corner case
      * v4l2sink: change rank to NONE so we don't try to autoplug it
      * videomixer: fix timestamping problems for input streams with different lengths
      * videomixer: fix problem when used with gnonlin (always send FLUSH_STOP)
